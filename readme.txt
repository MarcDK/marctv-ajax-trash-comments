=== MarcTV Moderate Comments  ===

Requires at least: 3.0
Tested up to: 4.0
Stable tag: 1.0.3

== Description ==

You need to be logged in as admin or any user with comment moderation permissions. A "trash" link will appear beneath
all comments in the frontend. Now you can mark comments as "trash" and they will disappear after a page reload.
Don't worry: You can "untrash" them if it was a mistake until you reload.

The plugin was written using phpStorm while I was on a trip to San Francisco, CA. My blog suffers from so many
comments that needed moderation. So I decided to make my life (and yours) easier. ;-)
